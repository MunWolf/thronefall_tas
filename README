# Thronefall TAS

Used to run tas files made for Thronefall

Changes from vanilla:
- Game is forced to run at 60 fps, if the computer fails to maintain that amount it will slow down gameplay as delta time is always 1 / 60 seconds
- Ingame Inputs are overwritten by the TAS when it is running.
- TAS control keys added
  - 1: Start/Stop TAS
  - 2: Pause/Unpause TAS
  - 3: Reload TAS file
  - 5: Go back to Main Menu
  - 9: Start/Stop recording
  - 0: Toggle info panel
  - Backspace: Enable frame stepping
  - Enter: Step a frame when frame stepping is enabled

The TAS selects which file to load based on what is set in its configuration file located at Thronefall\BepInEx\config\ThronefallTAS.cfg

## TAS File

A TAS file consist of a series of commands written as follows
<frame number>: <command> <parameters>

### TAS Commands

- `input <key> <1|0>` simulates a button press, 1 is down and 0 is up, available keys are
  - w
  - a
  - s
  - d
  - space
  - shift
  - ctrl
  - alt
  - tab
  - esc
- `axis <direction> <value>` simulates a joystick, direction is h or v for horizontal or vertical and value is any value from 1.0 to -1.0
- `wait <scene>` waits for a given scene to load before continuing to the next frame
- `reset` resets all inputs and axis to 0, any input or action defined on that frame after reset still apply
- `seed <s0> <s1> <s2> <s3>` sets the random state (look at UnityEngine.Random.state)
